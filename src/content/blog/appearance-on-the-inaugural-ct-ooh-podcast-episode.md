At the end of last year, Gareth Burns kindly invited me to take part in the inaugural episode of "CT-OOH" - a new series that promises to delve into the world of technology, leadership, and innovation.

In this first episode, I had the privilege to join alongside Andrew Brownlie. We engaged in a lively and insightful discussion about the role of the CTO in today's fast-paced digital landscape. The conversation ranged from our journies to CTO, and the innovative strategies that are shaping the future of tech.

Participating in this podcast was a fantastic way to chat with like-minded individuals and share my thoughts and experiences. Gareth and Andrew brought unique perspectives to the table, providing insights that I believe people interested in a CTO role would find useful.

For those interested in the intersection of technology and leadership, I highly recommend tuning in. You can catch the episode on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFSCHDUs-eA&pp=ygUGY3Qtb2ho). I'm eager to hear your thoughts on the discussion.

Happy listening!
