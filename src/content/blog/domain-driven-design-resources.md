As many of us hunker down in our homes during the COVID-19 crisis, we are all looking for things to do. I’ve been having a go at making a sourdough starter and reading books that have been sitting on my bookshelf for more years than I dare to admit.

I have been putting together a collection of resources that I’ve been given or have found over the years. So, if you’re at home and you’re at a loss for something to learn (or you’re still waiting on that Sourdough to be ready), here is a selection of useful links, books and resources that will help you on your way to learning more about DDD.
