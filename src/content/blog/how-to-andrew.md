ℹ️

This is a Manager README. It's heavily inspired by the concept created by [Michael Lopp](https://randsinrepose.com).

## Nuances

**I am an introvert** which means that I being around people depletes my energy. Perhaps a bit weird when I am a leader of people. By the end of the week, you might find I have much lower energy. If you want to grab my attention on something, try to get me earlier in the day.

**This document** is a living, breathing thing. It will likely change. After all, we all grow and adapt to new things. I'll update this regularly. If you have any feedback, please do reach out to me.
