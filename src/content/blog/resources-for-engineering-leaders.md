Transitioning from an IC to a manager can be both exciting and challenging.  It can be an opportunity to take on more responsibility, influence and impact in an organisation, but also requires a shift in mindset and skillset.

As a leader, it's also important to stay informed about industry trends and developments, as well as best practices in management. This will help you to stay up-to-date with the latest thinking and to be able to effectively lead your team.

Over the past five or so years, I’ve relied on so many different blogs, podcasts, books and other resources in my journey as an engineering leader.  I thought it might be useful to put these into a living document to share with other engineers who are moving into a leadership role, or for current leaders looking for some inspiration and motivation.
