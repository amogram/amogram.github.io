John Mark Comer in his book "[The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ruthless-Elimination-Hurry-emotionally-spiritually/dp/1529308380/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3VKHDISEVCNH7&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.6Q5QS0DKaJv0bkAzGyFKXl9CLd_gwRefAOnkC3ziWxF2MNNv0dGo1L20t4EHPkGMyQxsFDDjkvJ66CSxbRtY0YjsbtfsnUa7IZ5btr3T8VUuFihGKBfaoTmuN6Cn-Izl8MgycOlhM8AZZnJwi4b3uZAKIzKlf-CgqwFbeNx6h-rx6RT-lT0isBfERP3JeeSi.bvgEGJtXFeRgu0aLMm301DcltU2J9QXNUhSD8JeRfA8&dib_tag=se&keywords=the+ruthless+elimination+of+hurry&qid=1721169122&sprefix=The+ruthle%2Caps%2C109&sr=8-1)" advocates for the importance of rest, such as observing the Sabbath, to combat burnout and foster well-being.

He goes further by referring to the Israelites observing feasts during the year, such as Passover and the Feast of Tabernacles. The people would cease their daily work and focus on rest, worship, and community. 

These festivals often lasted for a week, offering a significant period of time to rest and reset.  

Perhaps ancient civilisations were on to something.

We all feel the benefit of extended periods of rest.  So if you have the privilege of having holidays to take off, be sure to incorporate longer periods of time off, maybe a week or so, thereby creating a rhythm that allows for significant breaks from the pressures and demands of everyday life, much like the Israelites did.
