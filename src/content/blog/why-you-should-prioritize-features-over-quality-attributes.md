In my [last blog post](/blog/why-you-should-prioritize-quality-attributes-over-features/), I made the case for focusing on quality attributes over features. But, as with most things when it comes to software development, it’s not that simple. The right approach depends on where your business is, how long your product is expected to last, and, frankly, what your runway looks like.

For early-stage startups, chasing perfection isn’t just unrealistic—it can be a distraction. Things like performance, scalability, and security are important, but they shouldn’t come at the expense of actually shipping something useful. In the beginning, what really matters is getting features out there that help you gain traction and grow.

## Speed Matters More Than Perfection

Startups move fast because they have to. Getting something in front of users quickly is often the difference between success and being forgotten. The goal isn’t to launch a perfect product—it’s to launch, learn, and iterate. Spending too much time refining quality attributes before you even know if you’re building the right thing can slow you down and limit the feedback you need to improve.

## Users Care About Features First

People adopt products because they solve problems, not because they’re perfectly optimized. If you’re spending all your time tweaking performance but haven’t delivered something people actually need, you’re missing the point. Features come first—once you have users and real demand, _then_ you can focus on refining the rest.

## You Have Limited Resources—Use Them Wisely

Let’s be real: most startups don’t have the luxury of unlimited time, money, or engineering power. Quality attributes take effort—designing for scale, security, and performance doesn’t come for free. In the early days, it makes sense to focus on what moves the needle: building and improving features that drive adoption. You can deal with technical debt and optimizations later when you actually have the resources to do it properly.

## The Balancing Act

This isn’t to say quality attributes don’t matter—just that there’s a time and place for them. Early on, the priority is building something people actually want. Once you’ve validated that, you can shift focus to making it more scalable, secure, and performant.

At its simplest, prioritizing features over quality attributes isn’t about cutting corners—it’s about being practical. Get something out there, see how people use it, and improve as you go. That’s how you build momentum, and in a startup, **momentum is everything**.
