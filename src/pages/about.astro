	<p>Hi, I’m Andrew McCaughan.</p>

	<p>
		Over the last decade I’ve operated on multiple levels as a leader in software teams and organisations.
		I’m strongest at growing and nurturing teams, and building the systems and habits that help organisations
		spot problems early, reduce friction, and steadily get better.
	</p>

	<p>
		I’ve led engineering and product groups, built teams from scratch, steadied delivery when things were
		wobbling, and helped teams become predictably high-performing.
	</p>

	<p>
		I’m at my best where the work matters and has a purpose. Public services, infrastructure, and products
		that improve everyday life are where I do my strongest work.
	</p>

		Previously, I was CTO at BuffaloGrid, where we built StreamSpot, a solar-powered edge device that provided
		reliable power and digital services without needing an internet connection. It was deployed in
		Bangladesh, Nigeria, Zambia, and Mozambique.  It's been the most rewarding experience of my working life so far. 
		It made me focus on importance of building reliable, distributed systems with significant
		financial constraints, and building products for a demographic chronically underserved by technology and digital services.{' '}

	</p>

	<p>
		Earlier in my career I worked with organisations including Philips and Intel, and I delivered projects
		in local government and energy as an independent contractor. I try to give back to an industry that’s
		given me a lot. I coach engineers and aspiring leaders, and I’ve done mentoring in various forms over
		the years. In the past, I helped organise and run DDD Belfast.
	</p>


	<p>
		On this blog I write about the craft of software engineering: the tensions between features and quality,
		speed and sustainability, and what real-world delivery teaches you.
